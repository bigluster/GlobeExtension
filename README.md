# GlobeExtension
===============
3D WebGL Globe visualization extension for Qlik Sense

After you unzip the files into your extensions directory and add it to your app, simply add 3 dimensions: "location name", latitude and longitude. Then add 1 measure which will determine the color and magnitude of each vector coming off of the globe.


This extension uses the [WebGL globe](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/globe) developed by the Google Data Arts Team. Enjoy!
