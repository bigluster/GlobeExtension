GlobeExtension
===============
3D WebGL Globe visualization extension for Qlik Sense

After you unzip the files into your extensions directory and add it to your app, simply add 3 dimensions: "location name", latitude and longitude. Then add 1 measure which will determine the color and magnitude of each vector coming off of the globe.

*This extension will not render directly inside of Sense Desktop. You must use the app in a [WebGL compatible browser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL#Desktop_browsers)* 
Direct your browser to http://localhost:4848/hub and open your app and then you can edit and view it there.

There is a sample app and example CSVs located in the data directory.

This extension uses the [WebGL globe](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/globe) developed by the Google Data Arts Team. Enjoy!
